Vampire Survivors Parody: Brief Description
This will work similar to Vampire Survivors. The player will control a character with the keyboard and have automatic attacks. Enemies will converge upon the playerâ€™s location until they are all wiped out. There will be three stages and the player will be able to choose between different sets of gear. However, there will be no leveling up or attaining new weapons during a game.
Based on: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Survivors

# Intended pacing:

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

### Entity Class Framework: Together
- getDirection()
- getImg()
- reverseImg()
- getX()
- getY()

### Character Class Framework: Zixi
- getHP()

### Player Character Framework: Zixi
- playerMovement()

### Enemy Character Framework: Zixi
- getSpeed()
- setSpeed(int newSpeed)
- convergeOnPlayer()

### Attack Projectile Framework: Alex
- getSpeed()
- setSpeed(int newSpeed)
- monodirectionalAttack()

### Draw Method: Together
- Drawing each entity
- Moving each entity
- Redrawing the background to make sure nothing stays between cycles

### Setup Method: Alex
- Draw the initial characters
- Draw the background
- Set up image assets to be used

### keyPressed: Alex
- Make sure that when WASD pressed character moves in corresponding direction.
