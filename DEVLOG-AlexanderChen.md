## Alexander Chen

### 2025-05-19 Worked on prototype, updated the DEVLOG and added a preliminary UML diagram
Planned a proposal in google docs with my partner during class and commited these changes into the doc. Also started canva work on the UML and made some progress in the broadstroke classes that we plan to use. Took about 41 minutes (or 1 period.)

### 2025-05-20 Worked on UML diagram + Finished on the first prototype file.
Partner and I added some extra parts and clarity for which methods are in each class, what they return and if they are private are public. Still requires some work. About a period
Worked on the UML diagram at home, optimizing layouts and cutting out unneeded methods and how the work was going to be divided afterschool. Around 30-ish minutes

### 2025-05-22 Worked on the intial code in Main
Worked on the code in main, although somewhat limited by the lack of the other classes. Tested out ways of checking timings, settling on an int counter in draw and set up an inital possible baseline for future code. About a period + 20 minutes at home.
