Vampire Survivors Parody: Brief Description
This will work similar to Vampire Survivors. The player will control a character with the keyboard and have automatic attacks. Enemies will converge upon the playerâ€™s location until they are all wiped out. There will be three stages and the player will be able to choose between different sets of gear. However, there will be no leveling up or attaining new weapons during a game.
