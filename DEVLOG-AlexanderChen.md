### 2025-05-19 Worked on prototype, updated the DEVLOG and added a preliminary UML diagram
Planned a proposal in google docs with my partner during class and commited these changes into the doc. Also started canva work on the UML and made some progress in the broadstroke classes that we plan to use. Took about 41 minutes (or 1 period.)

### 2025-05-20 Worked on UML diagram + Finished on the first prototype file.
Partner and I added some extra parts and clarity for which methods are in each class, what they return and if they are private are public. Still requires some work. About a period
Worked on the UML diagram at home, optimizing layouts and cutting out unneeded methods and how the work was going to be divided afterschool. Around 30-ish minutes

### 2025-05-22 Worked on the intial code in Main
Worked on the code in main, although somewhat limited by the lack of the other classes. Tested out ways of checking timings, settling on an int counter in draw and set up an inital possible baseline for future code. About a period + 20 minutes at home. 

### 2025-05-23 Continued work on the Weapons and got some advice from Mr. K. 
Worked on the code in the AttackProjectiles class as well as updating the UML diagram with the new information from this. About a period. 

### 2025-05-24 Light proofreading work and over planning certain issues
Worked on optimizing the early AttackProjectile code and started work planning on maps and how the setup and draw work work together. About 10 minutes of proofreading and 30 minute sof planning

### 2025-05-25 Images, Healthbar and incorperating the first instance with all the classes working
Worked on the Main file with updates made to the draw and setup, incorperation of images for the first time, mainly from the actual Vampire Surivors game, attempted making a handmade fireball that doesn't look too bad, testing of all the methods in PlayerCharacter, EnemyCharacter and AttackProjectile and fixing some bugs that popped up here and there. Around 2-3 hours of work. 

### 2025-05-26 More image work and assorted bugs
Fixed some issues with image not switching depending on the way the characters are facing and moving and fixed and issue where the projectiles would not appear based on where the character was facing. About 1-2 hours of work.
