# Dev Log:

This document must be updated daily every time you finish a work session.

## Alexander Chen

### 2025-05-19 Worked on prototype, updated the DEVLOG and added a preliminary UML diagram
Planned a proposal in google docs with my partner during class and commited these changes into the doc. Also started canva work on the UML and made some progress in the broadstroke classes that we plan to use. Took about 41 minutes (or 1 period.)

### 2025-05-20 Worked on UML diagram + Finished on the first prototype file.
Partner and I added some extra parts and clarity for which methods are in each class, what they return and if they are private are public. Still requires some work. About a period
Worked on the UML diagram at home, optimizing layouts and cutting out unneeded methods and how the work was going to be divided afterschool. Around 30-ish minutes

### 2025-05-22 Worked on the intial code in Main
Worked on the code in main, although somewhat limited by the lack of the other classes. Tested out ways of checking timings, settling on an int counter in draw and set up an inital possible baseline for future code. About a period + 20 minutes at home. 

### 2025-05-23 Continued work on the Weapons and got some advice from Mr. K. 
Worked on the code in the AttackProjectiles class as well as updating the UML diagram with the new information from this. About a period. 

### 2025-05-24 Light proofreading work and over planning certain issues
Worked on optimizing the early AttackProjectile code and started work planning on maps and how the setup and draw work work together. About 10 minutes of proofreading and 30 minute sof planning

### 2025-05-25 Images, Healthbar and incorperating the first instance with all the classes working
Worked on the Main file with updates made to the draw and setup, incorperation of images for the first time, mainly from the actual Vampire Surivors game, attempted making a handmade fireball that doesn't look too bad, testing of all the methods in PlayerCharacter, EnemyCharacter and AttackProjectile and fixing some bugs that popped up here and there. Around 2-3 hours of work. 

### 2025-05-26 More image work and assorted bugs
Fixed some issues with image not switching depending on the way the characters are facing and moving and fixed and issue where the projectiles would not appear based on where the character was facing. About 1-2 hours of work. 

### 2025-05-27 Some map work and game over screen
During class I tried to find some map images I could use for the vampire survivors map. After some searching it appeared there was none so I pivoted to try making the gameOver screen. Worked on imitating the Vampire Survivors game over screen and added the ability for the game to be restarted straight from the gameOver screen. Took about 1 pd and 1-2 hours. 

### 2025-05-28 Some testing for map tiles
Tested basic tiles before realizing they had to be scaled up to have any sort of visible features on the main screen. Attempted to make these larger tiles with some limited success at home. About 20 minutes during class and 1-2 hours at home. 

### 2025-05-29 Further map testing and timer implementation. 
Spent the first 20 minutes trying to fix a config error with my name and then spent the remaining period on seeing how the map looked on mac processing to some poor results. Moved on to attempting to implement a timer and bug testing/fixing. About 20 minutes during class. 

### 2025-05-30 Some more enemy edits
Added a new skeleton enemy and made some edits to its constructor for variety in enemy types. Also fixed some errors associated with their addition. About 1 hour. 

### 2025-05-31 Some enemy improvements
Added a new type of enemy, a charging enemy and added new methods to facilitate the charge and other assorted bug fixes to make sure that unneccessary data wasn't wasted with the new enemies. Took about 1-2 hours of work. 

### 2025-06-01 Attempted Map Revamp
Assisted in post bugfixing of the new map and movement system as well as attempting to make the backgrounds more visually interesting to less than stellar results. Left with a very basic system of tiles that will be improved later. About 1-2 hours of coding and 1-2 hours of trying to create assets. 

### 2025-06-02 ItemPickups
Started work with itemPickups and had a mostly functional health pickup by the end of the day. Planned additional weapon pickup to level up the weapon but current plans are unsure about implementation. About 45 minutes / 1 pd during the day and 1-2 hours at home. 

### 2025-06-03 Selection Screen
Added a character and weapon select screen before the game begins so you can select your starting weapon and starting character (although the character continues to only be cosmetic). 1 period during school and 1-2 hours at home. 

### 2025-06-04 Weapon leveling
Split the weapon spawns of the fireballs and knives and coded in the fireball level up system. Took 1 period during class

### 2025-06-05 Knife work and bible addition
Added the knife leveling system where the character throws more knives depending on the level and attempted to add the bible to it to some mixed results. About 2 hours. 

### 2025-06-06 Small work with bible and removal of some extraneous code. 
Removed some code that did the same thing both in main and in AttackProjectile when checking for out of bound projectiles, excluded bibles from this check and made their range high enough so that they didn't disappear while still doing their circle. About a period in class. 

### 2025-06-07 Fixed Bibles, fixed merge conflicts and some other bug fixes
Rewrote the bible code after much struggling with the current section of the bible code. It finally worked after an hour. Tried merging the two together with tons of merge conflicts that had to be sorted through slowly. Lastly, fixed some small errors. About 2-3 hours. 

### 2025-06-07 Final bug fixes, time stop cheat code and UML diagram update
Fixed some final bugs that occurred as testing before the video, added a time stop cheat code to be able to display the features easier and added all the missing functions and variables into the UML diagram. About 1-2 hours coding, 1-2 hours recording the video.
